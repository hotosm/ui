# HOTOSM UI

## Shared UI Components with HOT Theming

This repository contains HOT themed UI components to reduce code duplication
and simplify the lives of developers needing to prototype and develop well
designed web applications quickly.

They are available as
[Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)
and has first-class React support.

The main goal of this project is not to re-invent the wheel, or add an extra burden
of development and maintenance.
